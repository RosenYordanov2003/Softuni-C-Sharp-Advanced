In this workshop, we are going to create another custom data structure, which has similar functionalities as the C# doubly linked list. Just like the structures from the previous workshop, our custom doubly linked list will work only with integers. It will have the following functionalities: 
•void AddFirst(int element) – adds an element at the beginning of the collection
•void AddLast(int element) – adds an element at the end of the collection
•int RemoveFirst() – removes the element at the beginning of the collection
•int RemoveLast() – removes the element at the end of the collection
•void ForEach() – goes through the collection and executes a given action
•int[] ToArray() – returns the collection as an array
